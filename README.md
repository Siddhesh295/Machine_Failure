**MACHINE FAILURE PREDICTION**

Welcome to the Machine Failure Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict machine failures using a combination of data analysis and machine learning techniques. By accurately predicting when a machine might fail, businesses can take proactive measures to maintain equipment, thereby reducing downtime and saving costs.

**Project Overview**

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify potential machine failures before they occur. This will help in scheduling maintenance and reducing unexpected breakdowns.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data on machine performance, including various operational metrics and failure records. The data has been collected from multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

**Methodology**

Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous data entries.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Normalization: Scaling the data to ensure uniformity across features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing the distribution of features and their relationships with machine failures.
Identifying patterns and trends that could indicate potential failures.
Correlation analysis to understand the impact of different features on machine failure.

**Model Development**

Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and to evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve predictive accuracy.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git
